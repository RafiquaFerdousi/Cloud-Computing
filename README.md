# Cloud-Computing

##### Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources. Everything from applications to data centers, over the internet on a pay-for-use basis. Examples of computing resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. The cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three deployment models, and three service models.

##### The five essential characteristics of the cloud are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

##### There are three types of cloud deployment models—Public, Private, and Hybrid.

##### The three service models are based on the three layers in a computing stack - Infrastructure, Platform, and Applications. These cloud computing models are aptly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
